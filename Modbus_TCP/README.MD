## Start 🚀

_Be able to use the designs of the common modules to have available and apply to electronic designs._


### Pre requirements 📋

_Connectivity module that has functions using the ethernet-wifi-modbus 485 protocol._


### Conditions and Characteristic🔩
Its main Controller for the ethernet has the internal stack to carry out the communication tcp / ip w5100, it has a tool that opens an endless number of ways to control your Arduino through the Internet or your home LAN. Home automation, automation, Internet of things (IoT), remote control and monitoring, etc., are some of the fields where this shield can be used. It is compatible with Arduino Uno, Mega and Leonardo. In addition, the Ethernet and SD libraries are included by default, the microcontroller in charge of making it is a WROM esp32, it has external storage using SD
