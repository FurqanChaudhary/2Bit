## Start 🚀

_Be able to use the designs of the common modules to have available and apply to electronic designs._


### Pre requirements 📋

_The LM2596 series of regulators are monolithic integrated circuits that provide all the active functions for a step-down (buck) switching regulator, capable of driving a 3-A load with excellent line and load regulation. These devices are available in fixed output voltages of 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V, and an adjustable output version_


### Conditions and Characteristic🔩

It is capable of conducting a current of up to 3A. It handles a load with excellent line regulation and low ripple voltage. This device is available with adjustable output voltage


###### Dc-Dc step down
Based on the LM2596 regulator, output between 1.5 and 35Vdc
Input voltage: 4.5-40V
Output voltage: 1.5-35V (Adjustable)
Output current: Maximum 3A
Switching frequency: 150 KHz
