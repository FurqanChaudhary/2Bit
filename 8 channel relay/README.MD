## Start üöÄ

_Be able to use the designs of the common modules to have available and apply to electronic designs._


### Pre requirements üìã

_Relay board is one kind of very popular switch module. You can use it control any devices on or off. This is a DC5V controlled 8 channel relay module. It's high level trigger. Trigger current need not less than 5mA, It can be used in many industry system that using DC5V power supply._


### Conditions and Characteristicüî©
 8-Channel Relay interface board,
 Each one needs 15-20mA Driver Current
 Equiped with high-current relay : DC30V 10A AC250V 10A

It has a DC-DC Step Down LM2596 regulator which is a monolithic integrated circuit suitable for easy and convenient design of a buck type switching source. It is capable of conducting a current of up to 3A. It handles a load with excellent line regulation and low ripple voltage. This device is available with adjustable output voltage

###### Dc-Dc step down
Based on the LM2596 regulator, output between 1.5 and 35Vdc
Input voltage: 4.5-40V
Output voltage: 1.5-35V (Adjustable)
Output current: Maximum 3A
Dimensions: 43 * 20 * 14mm
Switching frequency: 150 KHz

###### Darlingtong
The ULN2803A device is a 50 V, 500 mA Darlington
transistor array. The device consists of eight NPN
Darlington pairs that feature high-voltage outputs with
common-cathode clamp diodes for switching
inductive loads. The collector-current rating of each
Darlington pair is 500 mA. The Darlington pairs may
be connected in parallel for higher current capability
